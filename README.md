**WOFOST-EW v1** is an improved version of the [WOFOST](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Environmental-Research/Facilities-Tools/Software-models-and-databases/WOFOST.htm) (World Food Studies Simulation Model) that improves crop growth simulations under extreme weather conditions. The model incorporates an **Extreme Weather Function** that integrates **Extreme Weather Indices** with an **LSTM deep learning algorithm** to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, the **SCE-UA optimization algorithm** is applied to achieve more efficient parameter calibration.

## Resources

### WOFOST Model
The base model is part of the **Python Crop Simulation Environment** (PCSE):
- [PCSE Documentation](https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [PCSE GitHub repository by Allard de Wit](https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse.git)

### SCE-UA Algorithm
For parameter calibration, the **SCE-UA algorithm** implementation is referenced in Spotpy:
- [Spotpy Documentation](https://spotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### LSTM Implementation
The **LSTM algorithm** is implemented using the **Keras** library:
